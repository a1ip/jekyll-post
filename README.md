# Post

#### A simple command line helper for Jekyll

## Usage

Create a post:
`post Some Post Title`

List all posts
`post list`

Edit a post
`post edit [some-post-title]`

Publish your blog
`post publish`

## Installation

If you have npm:

`npm install -g post-jekyll`

If you don't have npm, you will need to install it via [Node](http://nodejs.org/). Either download it from [the Node website](http://nodejs.org/) or install it via the command line. The latter will depend on your system, but here's a guess at what might work for you immediately:

Mac (with Homebrew):

`brew install node`

Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```

Enjoy.
